## Hello! I'm Teymarr
Hey there! I’m a first-generation college student and I’m currently in undergrad studying cybersecurity. I have two specializations in Python and ATA Analytics and Homeland Security. I chose cybersecurity because I’ve always been fascinated by technology. As a kid, I was always the one glued to my computer, while everyone else was playing outside. I could quickly grasp complex concepts, and I remember using Facebook and other social media platforms effortlessly when I was around 6 or 7 years old. That’s when I realized I wanted to break into the tech industry and I’ve been enjoying it ever since. I love doing fun investigations that cover topics like digital forensics and incident response. I think it’s a great way to gain hands-on experience. Outside of tech, I also enjoy working out a lot. This year, I lost 100 pounds in about 5 months, which was one of my biggest accomplishments. I’m excited to apply the hard work I’ve put in this year to my weight loss journey and apply it to working in a blue team scenario.

We like hard work! Hard work is good work! - Madame Vice President

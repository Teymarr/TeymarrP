## About Me
As an undergraduate cybersecurity professional specializing in threat and incident response, my skill set encompasses ethical hacking, hashing, and encoding techniques such as Base64. Additionally, I possess expertise in utilizing terminal commands to address intricate cybersecurity challenges. I am well-versed in dark web intelligence, including the utilization of tools like the Tor browser. Furthermore, I have gained practical experience in OSINT threat intelligence analysis, threat hunting, and ethical hacking methodologies.

With a robust foundation in cybersecurity principles and practical applications, I am motivated to confront emerging threats and fortify digital environments through innovative and effective solutions.

## Certifications:
- ArcX Foundation Level Threat Analyst
- ISC-2 Certified in Cybersecurity
- Security Blue Team Junior Analyst
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA CySa+

## Projects
Here are a few projects I have worked on:

1. **Threat Intelligence - Digital Forensics Investigation** 
   - Description: In this project, I assisted in the investigation of a criminal on the run, who posted images with the caption, "I'm roaming free. You will never catch me." The objective was to analyze the attached images to extract critical information that could help locate the criminal.

   - Using Homebrew, I installed ExifTool on my MacBook and leveraged Terminal to run the necessary commands to extract metadata from the images. This allowed me to retrieve important details such as the camera make and model, timestamp, and GPS coordinates embedded in the images. While the GPS coordinates initially pointed to the Pacific Ocean, I used TinEye for reverse image searching, which led me to discover the possible location of the image, revealing it to be Kathmandu, Nepal.

   - This project showcased my ability to combine digital forensics tools and investigative techniques to solve a real-world problem. It demonstrates my skills in metadata extraction, image analysis, and Threat intelligence research, and highlights my proficiency in using ExifTool and TinEye to gather and analyze evidence.
   - **Key Skills**: Metadata Extraction · Command Line Proficiency · Geolocation Analysis

2. **Dark Web Operations – Intelligence Gathering & Drug Trafficking Case**  
   - **Description**: Successfully completed the final challenge of the Dark Web Operations course by Security Blue. In this simulated law enforcement scenario, I was tasked with investigating a dark web marketplace used by drug traffickers. Using advanced tools such as the Tor browser and web inspection techniques, I gained access to a protected site and gathered intelligence on an ongoing criminal operation.

   - **Key Skills**: Gaining access to a secure dark web site by employing advanced browsing techniques with Tor and using the "Inspect Element" tool.
Decoding Base64-encoded data to retrieve critical user credentials necessary to log into the website.
Analyzing blog content and posts to uncover evidence linking the user to drug trafficking activities.
Identifying key details of an upcoming illegal shipment, including coordinates for the shipment’s destination.
During this hands-on challenge, I used a combination of cybersecurity tools, data decryption methods, and investigative techniques to successfully uncover vital intelligence. My investigation led to the discovery of shipment coordinates, which were traced to a port in London, along with a precise delivery date for the illegal cargo.

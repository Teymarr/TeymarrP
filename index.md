## About Me
As an undergraduate cybersecurity professional specializing in threat and incident response, my skill set encompasses ethical hacking, hashing, and encoding techniques such as Base64. Additionally, I possess expertise in utilizing terminal commands to address intricate cybersecurity challenges. I am well-versed in dark web intelligence, including the utilization of tools like the Tor browser. Furthermore, I have gained practical experience in OSINT threat intelligence analysis, threat hunting, and ethical hacking methodologies.

With a robust foundation in cybersecurity principles and practical applications, I am motivated to confront emerging threats and fortify digital environments through innovative and effective solutions.

## Certifications:
- ArcX Foundation Level Threat Analyst
- ISC-2 Certified in Cybersecurity
- Security Blue Team Junior Analyst


## Projects
Here are a few projects I have worked on:

1. **Threat Intelligence - Digital Forensics Investigation** 
This project involved assisting in the investigation of a criminal on the run, who posted images with the caption, "I'm roaming free. You will never catch me." The goal was to analyze these images to extract crucial information that could help track down the criminal's location.

**Steps Taken**:

**Metadata Extraction**: To begin, the images provided were analyzed for embedded metadata using ExifTool, a powerful tool for extracting and viewing metadata from various media files. After installing ExifTool on a MacBook using Homebrew and leveraging the Terminal, I extracted key pieces of information from the images, including the camera model, timestamp, and GPS coordinates.
Geolocation Analysis: Initially, the GPS coordinates extracted from the images pointed to a location in the Pacific Ocean. This required further investigation to pinpoint the criminal's actual whereabouts. To proceed, I used TinEye, a reverse image search tool, to search for similar images and gather context about their origin.
Investigative Research: The reverse image search led me to discover that the image was most likely taken in Kathmandu, Nepal. To refine this hypothesis, I reviewed the metadata further and noticed a reference to the word "temple" in one of the titles. A quick Google search for temples in Kathmandu led me to the Temple of Kathmandu, which seemed to align with the context provided by the image.
Conclusion: Combining the metadata extraction, reverse image search, and geographic research, I concluded that the criminal was likely in Kathmandu, Nepal, as of the time the images were posted.
Skills Demonstrated:

This project highlighted several important skills in digital forensics and threat intelligence, **including**:

**Metadata Extraction**: Using ExifTool to extract detailed metadata from images, such as camera model, timestamp, and GPS coordinates, which were crucial for identifying the criminal's location.
**Geolocation Analysis**: The ability to interpret and analyze geographic data embedded in image files and refine it through additional tools like TinEye for reverse image searching.
**Digital Forensics**: Leveraging forensic techniques to gather and analyze evidence from digital media, applying both technical knowledge and investigative skills to solve the case.
**Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: The ability to connect seemingly disparate pieces of information to uncover the location of the criminal and further the investigation.
**Tools Used**:

**ExifTool**: For extracting metadata from images to gather important details like camera model, timestamp, and GPS coordinates.
**TinEye**: A reverse image search tool that helped track the origin of the images, leading to the discovery of the criminal’s location.
Conclusion:

This project showcased my proficiency in digital forensics, metadata extraction, and investigative techniques, demonstrating my ability to solve complex problems through the use of digital tools. It provided valuable hands-on experience in applying cybersecurity knowledge to real-world scenarios, ultimately contributing to the resolution of a criminal investigation.

3. **Dark Web Operations – Intelligence Gathering & Drug Trafficking Case**  
   - **Description**: Successfully completed the final challenge of the Dark Web Operations course by Security Blue. In this simulated law enforcement scenario, I was tasked with investigating a dark web marketplace used by drug traffickers. Using advanced tools such as the Tor browser and web inspection techniques, I gained access to a protected site and gathered intelligence on an ongoing criminal operation.

   - **Key Skills**: Gaining access to a secure dark web site by employing advanced browsing techniques with Tor and using the "Inspect Element" tool.
Decoding Base64-encoded data to retrieve critical user credentials necessary to log into the website.
Analyzing blog content and posts to uncover evidence linking the user to drug trafficking activities.
Identifying key details of an upcoming illegal shipment, including coordinates for the shipment’s destination.
During this hands-on challenge, I used a combination of cybersecurity tools, data decryption methods, and investigative techniques to successfully uncover vital intelligence. My investigation led to the discovery of shipment coordinates, which were traced to a port in London, along with a precise delivery date for the illegal cargo.

## **Hey! I'm Teymarr** ðŸ‘‹
As a first-generation undergraduate cybersecurity professional specializing in Blue Team operations, I focus on threat detection, incident response, and securing digital environments. My expertise includes ethical hacking, hashing, and encoding techniques such as Base64, as well as leveraging terminal commands to solve complex cybersecurity challenges. I am also well-versed in dark web intelligence, utilizing tools like the Tor browser for research and threat analysis. In addition, I bring hands-on experience in OSINT threat intelligence, threat hunting, and employing ethical hacking methodologies to identify and mitigate potential risks.
